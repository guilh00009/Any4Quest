Put your own copy of ASTRO BOT Rescue Mission (European release CUSA12392, version 1.00) in
this folder, then start "Play Astro Bot VR.bat". Either form will do, anywhere in here:

- the game's folder, the one with eboot.bin in it, or
- the game's .pkg file: it is unpacked the first time, which takes a minute and about 13 GB.
  (Only a package made from a dump of the game can be unpacked. One downloaded from the
  PlayStation Store is encrypted and cannot be used.)

If the game is somewhere else, just start: a window asks where it is.

AstroQuest $version - ASTRO BOT Rescue Mission in VR, played on this PC and shown in a Meta
Quest through Virtual Desktop. https://github.com/bigmak94/AstroQuest

1. Put your own copy of the game in the games folder: its folder (the one with eboot.bin in
   it) or its .pkg file, which is unpacked the first time. Or skip this: a window asks where
   the game is. Keep this folder's path short, e.g. C:\Games\AstroQuest: the emulator cannot
   open the game's files whose full path would be longer than 260 characters.
2. Virtual Desktop: install the Streamer on this PC and choose VDXR as the OpenXR runtime in
   its Options. In the headset, set Virtual Desktop's frame rate to 120 (Streaming settings).
3. Connect the DualSense to this PC (USB cable, or Bluetooth paired with the PC, not with the
   headset). Without a gamepad the headset's Touch controllers play.
4. Connect Virtual Desktop to this PC, then start "Play Astro Bot VR.bat". (If the Microsoft
   Visual C++ runtime is missing, it says so and offers Microsoft's download.)

In the game: hold the controller where the outline is on the first screen; look at a planet
and press X to choose it; hold OPTIONS for a second to reset the view. Settings are in
pc-vr\settings.txt, the log in pc-vr\user\log\shad_log.txt, saves in pc-vr\user\home.

AstroQuest is free software under the GNU GPL, version 2 or later (LICENSE.txt); the source is
at the address above. It contains no part of the game: use it only with a game you own.
